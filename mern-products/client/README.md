# React + Vite
```npm install zustand```
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Key Features of Zustand:
Minimal and Fast: Zustand is lightweight and has a small API surface.

No Boilerplate: No need for actions, reducers, or sagas.

React Hook Based: You use useStore to access state directly.

Middleware Support: Supports logging, persistence, and more.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Works well with Next.js and other SSR setups.
